Docker Devbox
=============

A development environment containing:

* Emacs
* C/C++ compilers and tools
* Golang compilers and tools
* Python and tools
* PHP
* git
* tmux
* ssh
* Docker (inception)

The devbox is as stateless as possible, every dev done inside it is
doomed to be destroyed, unless pushed to an external Git
repository. The idea is to be able fire up a known environment on a
new box, without spending 3 hours to figure out what is needed.

Usage
-----

This is a personnal Devbox, without my own set of configs and
tools. If you want to use it, fork it and edit your configuration
files to your needs.
